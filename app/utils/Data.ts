        name: "Naples Yellow",
        hex: "#F9DB6D",
        description:
          "Paul Cézanne couldn’t imagine painting without it and was shocked when other artists were doing so; To him, Naples Yellow wasn’t just a color,it was the sun on his brush. Artist who used it: Paul Cézanne",
      },
      {
        name: "Chrome Yellow",
        hex: "#FBBA00",
        description: "Chrome yellow was the missing piece for artists chasing pure, luminous light and bold enough to stand beside vibrant reds and blues, it made Vincent Van Gogh’s sunflowers blaze with life. But beauty came at a cost: this brilliant yellow ages into brown, making even Van Gogh’s flowers fade as time steals their light.Artist who used it: Vincent Van Gogh",
      },
      {
        name: "Gamboge",
        hex: "#F4C460",
        description:
          "Crack open a lump of dull brown gamboge and like magic, it bursts into a yellow, so luminous it dazzled Rembrandt and Turner.But this radiant pigment came with a price: while it lit up canvases, it also emptied bowels, so toxic that Winsor & Newton workers had to work near a toilet. Artists who used it: Rembrandt, J.M.W. Turner, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and William Hooker.",
      },
      {
        name: "Orpiment",
        hex: "#F1C447",
        description:
          "So toxic it could kill you and so radiant it was irresistible. Orpiment was the golden yellow that lit up Tutankhamen’s tomb and Veronese’s Renaissance canvas. Its deadly charm came with a warning: it looked like treasure, but mixed with the wrong pigment or touched to the mouth, it could drive you mad or worse.Artist who used it: Paolo Veronese",
      },

      {
        name: "Imperial Yellow",
        hex: "#F3C122",
        description: "For over a thousand years, this royal yellow was so sacred that commoners were banned from wearing it. It was the color of dragons, emperors, and the very earth beneath heaven. So prized was this golden hue that it took root paste, moon timing, and mulberry ash to create and by the time Katharine Carl dipped her brush, its imperial reign was nearing its final stroke.Artist who used it: Katharine Augusta Carl",
      },
      {
        name: "Gold",
        hex: "#C8B45D",
        description: "Gold isn’t just shiny, it’s the metal of awe, devotion, and decadence, hammered into halos, stitched into royal tents, and swirled through Klimt’s painted dreams.From medieval altarpieces to Midas myths, artists didn’t love gold because it made things look real, they loved it because it made things look sacred, rich and beautiful but it always reminds us that desire, unchecked, can cost more than it’s worth.Artist who used it: Gustav Klimt",
      },
      {
        name: "Lead White",
        hex: "#E4E9ED",
        description: "Lead white made paintings last for centuries but poisoned the people who made them. Artists adored its creamy texture and opacity, but the same pigment that kept tomb murals fresh also killed women and workers who wore or made it. Artist who used it: Neri di Bicci.",
