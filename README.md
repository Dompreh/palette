## Palette

Colors once used by Renaissance masters, now they're yours. Each color has a bitesized backstory.

## Click any shade to copy its hex code.

#### More than Color. It’s History on a Hex Code.
You can pick any color today with a click. But what if that shade of blue once cost a king his crown? What if that red you're using was made from crushed bugs and was worth its weight in gold? What if yellow was once deadly and still ended up on the walls of royal chambers?

#### Palette is a color library with history.
It doesn’t just show you color swatches. It reveals the chaos, lust, murder, and madness behind them. 

We’ve collected the backstories of colors so that designers (graphic, UI, fashion, interior) all of you can pick not just what looks nice, but what means something. Because every design choice is a message, and every color has a past.

Use Palette when you want more than pretty.
Use it when you want to make people feel something
